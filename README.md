# Titanic Survival Prediction: Machine Learning Project

This repository contains a machine learning project focused on predicting passenger survival in the Titanic disaster using the famous Titanic dataset from Kaggle. The project explores different machine learning models and evaluates their performance based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## 🚀 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster using various machine learning algorithms. The dataset includes features such as age, gender, ticket class, and other attributes. 

We preprocess the data, train models, evaluate their performance, and compare the results using metrics and visualizations.
